          "Tere honthon ki muskaan kabhi kam na ho,<br />
          Tere khushiyon ka safar kabhi tham na ho,<br />
          Zindagi ki har subah itni pyari ho,<br />
          Ki kabhi bhi koi shaam gham na ho."<br />
          <br />
          "Zindagi ki raah me hamesha khilte rahe phool,<br />
          Har khushi ho teri saath, sab door ho jaayein gham ke jhool,<br />
          Tera har din ho rosni se roshan,<br />
          Yeh dua hai meri, Tanuja, tu rahe sada khushiyon mein ghul."<br />

Your laughter is like music to our ears, and your smile has the magical power to brighten even the gloomiest of days. On your special day, I want to take a moment to share how much you mean to all of us and how grateful we are for the wonderful person you are.

A Heartfelt Shayari 💕:<br />
“Tanuja tum ho itni khaas,<br />
Tumhari khushboo se mehka hai yeh aasman,<br />
Jaisa chaand khilte hai raaton mein,<br />
Tere saath bitaye har lamha hai anmol,<br />
Khud ko bhool jaate hain sab,<br />
Tere saath guzre har pal mein hai ik jadoo.”<br /><br />

Life with you is like a beautiful song that never seems to end. You are not just a friend; you are a treasure, a jewel that sparkles and shines wherever you go. You have a heart of gold, filled with kindness and compassion, always ready to help those in need. Your infectious spirit and zest for life inspire everyone around you to be better and to cherish every moment.<br />

On your birthday, I wish you all the happiness in the world, the kind that lights up your heart and fills your soul with warmth. May this year bring you closer to your dreams, and may you achieve everything you set your mind to. Remember, you are capable of achieving greatness, and I will always be here cheering you on!<br />
<br />
A Little Humor for the Day 😂:<br />
You know, Tanuja, birthdays are nature's way of telling us to eat more cake! 🎂 But be careful not to eat too much; I don’t want you to accidentally become a cake yourself! 😂 Just kidding! Remember, calories don’t count on your birthday, so go ahead and indulge!
<br /><br />
Also, here’s a joke just for you:<br />
 Why did the birthday cake go to school?<br />
Because it wanted to get a little “layered” education!<br /><br />

I hope that brought a smile to your face! Your laughter is the best gift, and I love seeing you happy.<br />  

More Wishes for You ✨:<br />
On this beautiful day, I wish you endless adventures and new experiences. May you travel to places you've only dreamed of, meet wonderful people, and create memories that you will cherish forever. You have the spirit of an explorer, and I hope this year allows you to discover new horizons.<br /><br />

“Aaj ka din hai khaas, khud ko samjho tum raja,<br />
Har khushi tumse judi hai, tum ho sabse aaja.”<br /><br />

Let’s make some unforgettable memories today! May your day be filled with laughter, love, and lots of cake. Surround yourself with the people you love, and don’t forget to let your hair down and enjoy every moment.
<br /><br />
A Sweet Message for the Sweetest Girl 🍭:<br />
Tanuja, your presence in our lives is like a sweet melody that resonates in our hearts. You have a unique way of making every day brighter, and your friendship is one of the most precious gifts I have ever received.
<br /><br />
“Tere saath har pal hai khubsurat,<br />
Teri muskurahat se hai khushiyon ki baat,<br />
Tanuja tu hai hamare liye ek noor,<br />
Har khushi ki wajah, tu hai sabse pyaari chahat.”<br /><br />

Your kindness knows no bounds, and I am endlessly grateful for every moment we share. You bring joy into our lives and make even the simplest moments extraordinary. Your laughter is infectious, and your spirit is uplifting. I wish you all the success, love, and happiness in the world because you truly deserve it.<br /><br />

Keep shining your light, and never let anyone dim your sparkle. You are unique, and the world needs more people like you.<br /><br />

A Birthday Wish for the Future 🎈:<br />
May this birthday be the beginning of a year filled with good luck, good health, and much happiness. May you find the strength to chase your dreams and the courage to overcome any obstacles that come your way.
<br /><br />
“Janam din par yeh dua hai meri,<br />
Har khushi mile tujhe, ho khuda ki kripa,<br />
Tere saath humesha rahe khushiyon ki baatein,<br />
Tanuja, tu rahe khush aur tujhse milne aaye har ek khushi.”<br /><br />

So, let’s raise a toast to you! May your day be as fabulous as you are. Celebrate big, enjoy the moments, and remember that we are all here for you, cheering you on as you take on this new year of life.<br />

On this special occasion, I want to express my gratitude for having you in my life. You are a blessing to everyone around you, and I feel incredibly lucky to call you my friend. Thank you for being you!
